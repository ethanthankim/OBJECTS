Practicing Taekwondo for more than 30 years, 47-year-old athlete Ka Wai has won dozens of medals throughout her career, but none of them comes as special as this gold medal of the 2024 Canadian Taekwondo Poomsae National Championship, which she earned while battling cancer.
Ka Wai was born and raised in Hong Kong, moved to Canada in her teenage years with her family, and later returned to Hong Kong to develop her career. Although she has practiced Taekwondo Sparring since she was young, she only switched to Taekwondo Poomsae in recent years. Unlike combatting others, Poomsae focuses on performing a sequence of moves with precision and accuracy. Being a hardworking and talented athlete, Ka Wai soon became part of the Hong Kong Taekwondo Poomsae Team, as well as the silver medalist of the 2022 Asian Championships. 
In early 2023, Ka Wai relocated to Toronto once again with her husband. As she wanted to become part of the Canada National Team, she started training for the 2024 National Championships right away. 
Life is full of unexpected twists and turns. Ka Wai was diagnosed with TNBC, an aggressive type of invasive breast cancer, in June 2023. By the time she discovered the cancer, it was already at stage 3 and spread to her lymph nodes within a month. She had no choice but to stop practicing Taekwondo and start a year-long treatment. "I did not have any bad feelings at that time," said the always optimistic Ka Wai with a smile on her face, "because I thought it was just a sickness, like a flu or cold. Maybe because I am an athlete, so no matter what happens to me, I just think about how to resolve it, how to get over it." 
Luckily, she got a professional and considerate medical team to back her up. The team has designed a tailored treatment plan for Ka Wai. Since TNBC is not responsive to hormone therapy and targeted drugs, traditional chemotherapy and surgery are the only way out. The medical team decided to let Ka Wai first go through 5-month long chemotherapy starting in July, together with immunotherapy as she has an autoimmune disease history. These were followed by the tumor removal surgery in January, and she would have enough time to recover before the National Championships scheduled in February. The remaining treatment would continue after the tournament.
"I started counting since July, OK, 5 months, which means my last chemo will be in November, then maybe I can still participate in the Championships. As long as I try my best to exercise and keep training at home, making sure not to deteriorate so much." Despite feeling very weak and fatigued during the chemotherapy, Ka Wai still pushed herself to do some stretching and light exercise every day. It was very hard but the strong athlete never thought of giving up, "Because Taekwondo is part of my life, and I really, really want to represent Canada."
However, when it rains, it pours. In August, after Ka Wai had her second immunotherapy shot, she got severe pneumonitis. She went to the emergency room and was admitted to the hospital. For two days she almost could not breathe and had to be put on a ventilator. She stayed in the hospital for a week to get intensive antibiotics treatment. As her body was extremely vulnerable, she had no choice but to put the chemotherapy on hold until she recovered from pneumonitis. Even as optimistic as she has always been, Ka Wai inevitably felt discouraged at this point, "I was worried if the chemo was held up, will the cancer grow again?" She was also concerned if the delay in treatment would hinder her from taking part in the National Championships.
But miracles happen to those who believe in them. The National Championships was delayed to March, giving her enough time to recover from the tumor removal surgery. "I think it was very amazing that they changed the schedule. I was very happy because it exactly matched my schedule. I really felt the blessings from God." said Ka Wai. God helps those who help themselves, she finally won the gold medal in the division of females under 50 and officially became part of Team Canada. Now she has also claimed victory in the battle of cancer â€“ all cancer cells were cleared from her body, after a few months of radiation treatment.
Looking back at this journey with ups and downs, Ka Wai described herself as a "very crazy" person. She believes that it was the many years of Taekwondo training that helped her overcome all the challenges, "Taekwondo makes me strong, confident and resilient. Even in the treatment room, I saw the other patients all looked very upset. But I was stretching because it was quite boring," she giggled. "Sometimes I would talk to other patients and cheer them up. Telling them nothing to worry about, it will pass very soon." 
It was also Taekwondo Poomsae that helped pull the once devastated Ka Wai out from the darkness after her beloved father passed away 10 years ago. This was what made this sport so special to her. "Every time I attend a tournament, my daddy is watching over me, he will be proud of me."
Now as a Team Canada Taekwondo Poomsae athlete, Ka Wai has all her mind in practicing for the upcoming World Championships in December. "It's just 5 months away. I am still worried about whether my cardio is good enough to participate in the World Championships. Of course, I want to get a medal from the Championships. Again, I will try my best."
