Mariam, a girl from Tunisia, cherishes a small jewelry box she received on her sixteenth birthday. It was a gift from one of her close friends, filled with Chanel makeup, a delightful surprise for young Mariam. Though it originally held mascara and lipstick, the jewelry box soon became a repository for her growing collection of jewelry.
For nine years, the jewelry box has accompanied Mariam across continents. Starting in Tunisia, she traveled with her to Madrid and then to Canada. Despite its small size and the inconvenience it sometimes causes, Mariam never considered replacing it, “It just kept following me,” she often says, reflecting on how the jewelry box became a constant in her ever-changing life.
In Tunisia, the jewelry box sat on her dresser, a reminder of her friend's thoughtful gesture and the thrill of discovering Chanel makeup inside. When she moved to Madrid for her studies, it was one of the first things she packed. Amidst the excitement and anxiety of a new city, the jewelry box provided a sense of familiarity and comfort. It held not just her jewelry but pieces of her past, connecting her to her roots.
Years later, when Mariam moved to Canada for work, the jewelry box made the journey once again. Each time she opens it, she is transported back to her sixteenth birthday, her friend's smiling face, and the moment of joy and surprise. The box, with its sentimental value, reminds her of the various stages of her life and the places she has called home.
In her current home in Canada, the jewelry box sits on a small table alongside a lamp, books, and a cherished photo of her and her mother. It’s a part of her personal sanctuary, a space filled with things she loves. Though the box has grown too small for her expanding jewelry collection, Mariam plans to keep it. She might repurpose it for only rings or earrings, ensuring it remains a part of her life.
Mariam's jewelry box, much like her, has journeyed far. It’s a small object with a big story, a testament to enduring friendships, the passage of time, and the importance of holding onto things that carry pieces of our past. Through the jewelry box, Mariam's memories and experiences are kept alive, a symbol of her journey from Tunisia to Canada and everything in between.
