Hayam’s sewing machine sits in her living room, an elegant piece encased in glass, with a lamp that casts a gentle glow on its timeworn surface. This sewing machine, almost a hundred years old, is more than just a decorative object. It is a repository of memories, a tangible link to her family's past, and a symbol of the bonds between the women in her family.
Hayam received the sewing machine from her mother a decade ago. Her mother, in turn, had inherited it from her own mother when Hayam was just a child. The sewing machine was purchased in the 1920s by Hayam’s grandmother, who used it to sew her wedding dress and other clothes for her wedding. Over the years, it became a staple in the family, used to create wedding dresses for Hayam’s mother, aunts, and even Hayam and her sisters.
The sewing machine holds a special place in Hayam’s heart because it is entwined with so many cherished memories. “We used to gather for Eid and weddings to sew our clothes,” she recalled. The women in the family would come together, making an event out of it, staying up late into the night, sharing stories and laughter as they worked. Hayam first learned to sew on this machine, guided by her mother and grandmother. The machine is a testament to the skills and creativity passed down through generations.
Now, the sewing machine is a centerpiece in Hayam’s living room. It is carefully protected by a glass case, with a lamp highlighting its historical and emotional significance. “This machine is part of my house now, I can’t imagine giving it away,” Hayam said. The century-old sewing machine is a family heirloom that she plans to pass on to one of her daughters, provided they feel the same attachment to it. It is their great-grandmother’s machine, a symbol of their family’s enduring legacy.
Every time Hayam looks at the sewing machine, she is reminded of her grandmother’s beautiful wedding dress and the countless other garments that were lovingly crafted on it. The sewing machine is more than just an object; it is a vessel of family history, love, and the unbreakable thread that connects the past and the present. Through this machine, the stories and memories of Hayam’s family continue to live on, as a cherished part of their heritage.
