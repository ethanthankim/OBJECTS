        quote: `It was given to my great uncle by my great-grandmother as he was going to WWII. It was basically like "Oh you are going to war, here's a good luck charm to make sure that you get through it." It's like one of the only remaining things that represent my great uncle because my great uncle actually passed during the war. He never came home but this elephant did, so in a sense it almost kind of represents him. In his dying moment, he gave it to his commanding officer. He basically said, "Hey, it's really important that you get this back home to my mother." Because it's kind of like a promise that he's gonna come back. Only a piece of him came back in the form of that talisman. It represents a passed family member who died too soon. He was only 21 when he died.`,

I think this might not be easy to reach for normal people, but I got it even I was carrying cancer. I think this is what makes this medal more meaningful.",

It reminds me that in a country where minorities were a very small percentage, the fact that we were able to have a business like that and be successful at it, it kind of reminds me that in a country like Pakistan, minorities can actually survive, and we did for many many years.",
